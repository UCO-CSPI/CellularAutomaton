class Cell:
    """Cell is an object for cellular automaton simulations (especially game of life simulations).

    The cell object will keep track of its state, neighbors and update itself when update is called.
    This object is for the cell only.  It does not create an entire grid, nor can it determine what
    its neighbors are.

    Class variables:
        These are the same for all instances of the class.

        ProbInitialTrue = 0.5   ->  Used in __init__ to determine if the cell is initialized to
                                    True or False.

    Instance Variables (or Data Attributes):
        These are unique for each instance of the class.

        .state          ->  In the game of life, this tracks if the cell is 'alive' or 'dead.'
        .value          ->  Python expects this attribute to be returned in various cases.
        .Neighbors[]    ->  List of cell neighbors.  This list is used by update to know where to
                            check values.  This list must be set before calls to update.
                            This class provides no functionality for calculating the neighbors.
        .OldState       ->  Used in update to store the cell value from the previous time step.
                            This enables all cells to calculate their new state based on values
                            from the previous time step.
        .UpdateCount    ->  Number of times .update has completed.

    Methods:
        These are the functions of the class.
        update          ->  Calculates and sets cell value for the single timestep.
                            It calculates .state and updates .value.
                            This method does not modify .OldState
    Helper Functions:
        While it is not a member of this class, in this file there are two helper functions:

        SetNeighbors sets the neighbor values for all cells in a grid.
        SetOldStates sets .OldState = .State for  all cells in a grid.

class CAGrid(numpy.ndarray):
    """Class for implementing cellular automaton grid simulations.

    Provides a framework for implementing 2D cellular automaton (CA) simulations using numpy arrays.
    Each instance of the class has a numpy array for the cell data.  The class automatically creates
    boundary cells surrounding the simulation grid.  It also creates views into the simulation grid,
    boundary cells, and neighbor cells for use with numpy array calculation calls.

    Since this class inherits numpy.ndarray, several unique approaches must be used (espicially for
    class instance creation.)  The document at
    https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.subclassing.html explains using ndarray as a
    subclass and these special approaches.

    Also important is the concept of an array view.  A view to an array does not use new data in
    memory, but simply 'views' the data which already exists.  This is explained some at
    https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html#copies-and-views
    Because of this efficiency, this class creates many views into the grid.  These views can be
    used later for efficient calculation through numpy calls rather than iterating over items
    through interpreted python code.

    Class methods and attributes Inherited:
    All the instance variables associated with Numpy ndarray such as .shape, .dtype
    A complete list of ndarray methods and attributes is available at
    https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray


    The new class methods are:
    __new__ -> class initialization method.
                The array (or grid) shape must be provided.  The constructor will not take data.
                It creates an array 2 cells (or nodes) larger than the shape argument passed.  This
                allows for boundary cells in each direction.  The constructor returns a numpy array
                for the main simulation data. This is actually a view into the data of the bigger
                array which also contains boundary cells.  The bigger array is available through
                .Base or .base. The constructor also creates view arrays for the neighbors to
                the top, top right, left, bottom left ...

    __array_finalize_ ->  Always called after initialization.  It does not currently do anything.

    __init__ -> Not used since it is not always called for subclasses of ndarray.

    Update ->   Implements the rules of the cellular automaton
                Currently implements a simulation using 'game of life rules.'
                To implement other cellular automaton simulations, either:
                    1.) Change the code in this file (especially Update)
                    2.) Create a new class which inherits this class with
                        class NewClass(CAGrid):
                        and include in that class an update function which will replace the
                        one here.

    FinishUpdate -> Completes tasks after update
                    After cell values are updated, there are several tasks which must be completed
                    to prepare the CAGrid object for display and/or the next call to update.
                    Currently, this includes calling SetValue and SetBoundary.

    SetValue -> Sets the 'Value' field for the stuctured array.
                This function is somewhat tied to the Game of Life Simulation.
                The purpose of this function is do a fast conversion to float values as
                expected by matplotlib.matshow.

    SetBoundary ->  Sets the boundary conditions by copying cells from main simulation grid
                    to the boundary cells.

    New Data Attributes or Instance Variables are:
    .Base or .base ->   The large array which includes the boundary cells.
                        .base is the normal attribute for a numpy array.
                            The array returned by the constructor is actualy a view into the larger
                            array.  So numpy automatically creates this reference.
                        .Base is created in the constructor.  It is probably not needed.  It might be
                            needed to keep the larger array in memory.

    .Neighbors[]  ->    List of arrays which are views which give the cell's neighbor in a direction.
                        In other words, one of the neighbors is TopLeft.  Accessing TopLeft[3][4]
                        returns the grid node at [2][3].
                        Diagonal neighbor arrays are included in the list.

    .Old    ->          Attribute which has the same attributes as the CAGrid object.  .Old is for
                        storing the old state of the object before update if necessary.
    .TrueArray  ->      Array of True values for use in mask/array operations.  It is the same size
                        as the simulation grid, not the base grid.  Used for update calculations.
                        Declaring .TrueArray makes the code run faster because memory is not created
                        with each update.  Since it is an instance variable, it is created and
                        initialized only once per simulation.
    .count      ->      Used by the game of life update to count number of alive neighbors.
    .UpdateCount    ->  Tracks the number of times Update is called.
